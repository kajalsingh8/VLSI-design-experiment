## Introduction

This repository contains LTspice simulations for various electronic circuits commonly studied in electrical engineering and electronics courses. LTspice is a powerful, free circuit simulation software that allows for the design and testing of electronic circuits. The simulations here cover basic gates, amplifiers, and filters, and are intended for educational purposes.

## Experiments

### AND Gate using CMOS

- *Description:* This simulation demonstrates a basic AND gate constructed using CMOS technology. CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology is widely used in digital circuits for its low power consumption.
