## Introduction

This repository contains LTspice simulations for various electronic circuits commonly studied in electrical engineering and electronics courses. LTspice is a powerful, free circuit simulation software that allows for the design and testing of electronic circuits. The simulations here cover basic gates, amplifiers, and filters, and are intended for educational purposes.

## Experiments

### AND Gate using CMOS

- *Description:* This simulation demonstrates a basic AND gate constructed using CMOS technology. CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology is widely used in digital circuits for its low power consumption.


### Differential Amplifier

- *Description:* This simulation shows a differential amplifier, which amplifies the difference between two input signals. Differential amplifiers are essential in many analog systems and are a fundamental component of operational amplifiers.


### Instrumentation Amplifier

- *Description:* An instrumentation amplifier is a type of differential amplifier with high input impedance and low output impedance. It's commonly used for precise, low-level signal amplification.


### Inverting Amplifier

- *Description:* This simulation illustrates an inverting amplifier, which inverts the input signal and provides amplification. The inverting amplifier is a basic building block in analog electronics.


### Non-Inverting Amplifier

- *Description:* This simulation demonstrates a non-inverting amplifier, which provides amplification without inverting the input signal. It's another fundamental amplifier configuration.

### High-Pass Filter

- *Description:* This simulation showcases a high-pass filter, which allows signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating lower frequencies.


### Low-Pass Filter

- *Description:* This simulation demonstrates a low-pass filter, which allows signals with a frequency lower than a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating higher frequencies.
